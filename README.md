### Project Title:
Bikeshare Project

### Description:
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price.

In this project, I was able to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

The program code includes a main() fuction that control the flow of the input and analytical fuctions. Also include a UI for Users to enter their inputs.

### Data Files Used:
chicago.csv
New_York_City.csv
Washington.csv

Note: Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities.

### Credits
Thanks to Udacity mentors: Ala and Juan Felipe for responding to my questions posted.
